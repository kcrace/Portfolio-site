              <h3>Fort Fremont. Beaufort, SC</h3>
              <p>The boardwalk is reintroduced, following the path of the fort’s previous dock eroded over time. A greenhouse stands to house the medicinal plants of the Gullah tribe and acts as a gallery to display their preserved presence. A traditional slave home is built to spatially stand as a reference. A gallery of walls is built to direct the individual into direct confrontation with images of the past at human scale. The beacons are splayed throughout to offer a garden of stories that gather new meanings and connections as you move from one to the next. The instances are gathered to the north and begin to fade to the fort’s south like a gradient revealing what has been built and what remains.</p>

Its glory is in its Age, and in that deep sense of voicefulness, of stern watching, of mysterious sympathy, nay, even of approval or condemnation, which we feel in walls that have long been washed by the passing waves of humanity. It is in their lasting witness against men, in their quiet contrast with the transitional character of all things, in the strength which ...maintains its sculptured shapeliness for a time insuperable, connects forgotten and following ages with each other, and half constitutes the identity, as it concentrates the sympathy of nations: it is in the golden stain of time, that we are to look for the real light, and colour, and preciousness of architecture; and it is not until a building has assumed this character, till it has been entrusted with the fame, and hallowed by the deeds of men, till its walls have been witnesses of suffering, and its pillars rise out of the shadows of death, that its existence, more lasting as it is than that of the natural objects of the world around it, can be gifted with even so much as these possess, of language and of life....<span> "</span></p>

              <h1>The Site</h1>
              <p>Beaufort, SC was occupied by the Spanish in the early 1500’s, and then the French before the English came in 1629. Its water’s depthallow for it to be a very accessible port by naval ships. The city was almost destroyed in 1715 by the Indian War and saw much action during the Revolutionary war. The county was largely spared during the Civil War because Union occupation was swift and at the start of the war. Beaufort had a period of great wealth from indigo and rice farming and stood as one of the wealthiest cities on the east coast. This sparked the construction of many plantation homes. The nearby Penn center is one of the first schools built to educate recently freed slaves.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 10%;">&nbsp;<p>
              <p>I am interested in the contrasting levels of preservation of Beaufort. There is the cultural preservation of the Gullah people, the material preservation of the immense war bunkers, the historic preservation of the Penn center, and the artistic preservation of its history through numerous stories and photographs.</p>

             <h2>Thesis Abstract</h2>
             <p>History is often represented through reenactment, architectural pastiche or preservation. More specifically, the inheritance of place, the accumulation of past, remains a determining factor that perhaps most shapes a site’s present condition, its present being. I argue that a current stance on preservation, recreating an artifact to be frozen in a period of time, erodes the inheritance of an object or place, and that, rather, a participatory attachment between artifact and protagonist is a more lasting means of preservation. History already operates as a myth, a myth created by multiple authors amongst multiple biases. The creation of a new myth between artifact and individual prolongs and facilitates the great inheritance of place.</p>
             <p style="font-size: 10%;">&nbsp;<p>
             <p>As history begins to interact with the individual, it begins to shed its carefulness. Fiction begins to emulsify the boundaries of history and individual. Myth does not stain history; rather, myth offers a means of preservation, a means of continuation. The story remains tethered to the narrator, and tethered to the artifact. I propose an archive to facilitate such an attachment.</p>
             <p style="font-size: 10%;">&nbsp;<p>
             <p>I intend to forge a bond between individual and the heritage of place, a relationship between protagonist and story. An architecture, a curation of myth, stands as a projection of a site’s history. A projection elongates an instance, absorbs a feeling, extends a future, and stands as an artifice to blur the reality behind. Through fragment and the layering of instances, a comprehensive whole emerges through experience and the historical discovery of place.</p>
