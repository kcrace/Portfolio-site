        <p>My work is inspired by historical revivals, humor, myth, interactions between text and image, and Anglo-American cultural exchange. I focus primarily on British art, but I am equally at home with American art of the nineteenth- and twentieth-centuries, as shown in the diverse range of my research topics: the Gothic revival in the American South, the iconography of King Arthur in America, and Bloomsbury painters in New Mexico. <strong>My current project explores</strong> the interwoven relations between <strong>the collecting habits, fictional writings, and visual output of interwar authors</strong> and artists such as Evelyn Waugh and Carl Van Vechten. </p>
